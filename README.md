## Angular 10 and Firebase demo

#### Live demo: https://e-shop-demo-70a90.web.app/

This is an e-shop demo for a music store. The application uses Angular 10 for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end.
The app has only demonstration purposes and the data does not reflect the reality. Also, no transactions take place, as this is beyond the purpose of the project's scope.

The main topics that are covered in this demo are:

-- Create a User Interface with Angular 10

-- Create a back-end and database with Firebase

-- Authentication and Authorization

-- Roles in the app

-- Components that have sync data

-- Search bar

-- Validators

-- Auth Guards

-- Routing

-- Modularization
